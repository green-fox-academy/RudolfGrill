        <div class="green box text">Quidditch is a wizarding sport played on broomsticks. It is themost popular game
          and most well-known game among wizards and witches, and, according to Rubeus Hagrid, the equivalent to
          Muggles' passion for football.

        <div class="green box text">"This... is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's
          very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got
          to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker,
          because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly
          always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught,
          so it can go on for ages —"—Description of the Snitch and a Seeker's job
